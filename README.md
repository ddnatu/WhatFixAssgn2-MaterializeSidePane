Unitary Exercise Angular + D3.js

download the zip folder and run :-

npm install
node app.js

Just right after downloading , a quick peek into the folder structure and arrange it before running the command in Terminal.
How to arrange :-

In the root folder, the files would be 

node_modules after running npm install on Terminal.
app.js
package.json
README.MD
and a folder named as 'public'

Inisde the 'public' folder the following files would be there :-

index.html
myApp.js
myCtrl.js
myDirective.js
myService.js
&
data.json


Because of CORS issue , Data was being fetched by data.json using a dummy service but now it is fixed just you need to enable the CORS plugin in the chrome or you can host the service on localhost:3000 and run it from there to remove CORS error.

The UI is not completed properly and also the D3.js is not perfect as i had lost the touch with it being done it a long time back.
